Code to perform all tree (Binary search Tree) based operations in general.
Program performs a menu driven operation depending on user input. By defalt a sample tree is constructed which can be modified in code, as well as deleted using the menu operations available.
Basic operations available are:

- Add a node to BST
- Delete a node form BST
- Print Preorder Traversal
- Print Inorder Traversal
- Print Postorder Traversal
- Print Level Order Traversal
- Check if a node is present in BST
- Get Size of BST
- Get Longest path in BST
- Check is any path in BST sums to a particular value
- Print all paths from root to leaves
- Make Mirror of BST
- Double the BST by adding a left child with same value as current node 
- Check if 2 BST are same
- Check is a given BST is valid BST
- Check if the BST is balanced depending on user provided maximum difference value acceptible.
- Count number of trees possible for an input 1...N (Catalan number). Does it using recursion and Dynamic Programming. Essentially, direct formula to verify answer is ->  [(2N)! / ((n+1)!*(n)!)]
