Program contains code to print path for minimum hops required to traverse an array.
Solution was developed in VS2015 using C#.

It takes a greedy approach and has a worst case time complexity of less than O(n^2)

Assumes to receive input from the file with numbers present line by line. Prints one of the path amongst many paths possible. 
Path printed is the value of index and not the value present in the array.
